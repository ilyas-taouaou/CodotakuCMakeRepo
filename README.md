A repo demonstrating how to setup various Modern CMake dependencies from source through Git and CPM.

Clone, Configure and Build, no bullshit!

Current dependencies:
- SDL 3
- SDL_image
- ImGui
- Flecs
- SQLCpp (Sqlite)

Will grow on demand, just comment or remove the dependencies you don't need on your own project, this is meant to be a template

It's my humble solution that I suggest to fix global the mess of setting up C++ dependencies, it shouldn't be that hard!

Please post an issue or pull request if you're having trouble building one of the existing or a newer dependency.
